# Deep Cuts Playlist Generator FE

This is a frontend for the Deep Cuts Playlist Generator. Currently, it must be run alongside the deep-cuts-be app (https://github.com/TheOtherDavid/deep-cuts-be). It generates a page with a form that accepts a Spotify playlist ID, then sends that ID to the backend to have a new playlist generated.

## Running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
